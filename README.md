# WeatherApp
A weather app for iOS that displays forecast information from the Dark Sky API.

In order to get this to work, you will need to create a struct called Secrets with a static constant called ApiKey and assign your Dark Sky api key to this. 

```
struct Secret {
  static let apiKey = "YOUR DARK SKY API KEY HERE"
}
```
